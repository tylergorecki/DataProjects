# Tyler Gorecki Data Projects

In this repository, I have multiple data projects I have worked on inside/outside of the classroom. These include projects coding in both R and Python across multiple sports. 

### Expected Points Project (Fall 22):
This was a project for my advanced sports analytics course in which we were tasked with creating an expected points model using data from the 2019 NCAA Football season. Using the created model, we wanted to analyze when field goals become not worth the risk (or differently put, when the expected points of punting is greater than the expected points of attempting the field goal). This was a fun project that we worked on for most of the semester using many new techniques in R. 

### NBA Late Shooting Project (Spring 22): 
This was a project in which I attempted to analyze if there is a true difference when shooting late (less than 2 minutes left in 4Q or OT) in NBA games or if the perceived difference is only due to the smaller sample size. I coded this in python and found that shooting percentages were typically lower across the entire league. This used play-by-play data from the 2019-20 NBA season. (Worked with a group, but I ended up doing all of the coding and most of the analysis, so I took out the paragraph they wrote and added more myself. I didn't want to fall behind on the work and my group members didn't want to do anything early on so I took control.)

### PGA Project (Spring 22): <google.com>
In this project, I analyzed the statistic in golf that is most indicative of a golfers success on tour. I used both ESPN statistics and PGA Tour advanced analytics from 2020-21 to perform this analysis in R. I used heavy plotting to gain this insight and have a better understanding of the questions presented. I found that among PGA Tour golfers, approach shots are most significant, but obviously there's little room for error in every part of a golfer's game. 

### NBA Salaries Project (Fall 21): 
My group used multiple linear regression to attempt to predict NBA salaries using actual statistics from the previous season. This was one of my first times working with a large analytics dataset and helped me gain experience with cleaning data. I  do not have access to the code (done in SAS) to share because one of my group members has the file. We created a somewhat strong model that with more time and tweaking we could've made stronger. The biggest issue that we didn't see until too late was that we should've only included players who got new contracts. With just one year of data, this would've led to a sample size that was too small, but better results would've been seen if we thought about this sooner.
