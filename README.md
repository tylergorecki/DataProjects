# Statistics-Projects

In this repository, I have multiple statistics projects I have worked on inside/outside of the classroom. These include projects coding in both R and Python across multiple sports. 

### Expected Points Project:
This was a project for my advanced sports analytics course in which we were tasked with creating an expected points model using data from the 2019 NCAA Football season. Using the created model, we wanted to analyze when field goals become not worth the risk (or differently put, when the expected points of punting is greater than the expected points of attempting the field goal). This was a fun project that we worked on for most of the semester using many new techniques in R. 

### NBA Late Shooting Project: 
This was a project in which I attempted to analyze if there is a true difference when shooting late (less than 2 minutes left in 4Q or OT) in NBA games or if the perceived difference is only due to the smaller sample size. I coded this in python and found that shooting percentages were typically lower across the entire league. This used play-by-play data from the 2019-20 NBA season. 

### PGA Project: 
In this project, I analyzed the statistic in golf that is most indicative of a golfers success on tour. I used both ESPN statistics and PGA Tour advanced analytics from 2020-21 to perform this analysis in R. I used heavy plotting to gain this insight and have a better understanding of the questions presented. I found that among PGA Tour golfers, approach shots are most significant.
